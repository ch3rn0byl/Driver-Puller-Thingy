# Driver-Puller-Thingy

Ran into obfuscated drivers, which is a pain in the dick to deal with. Instead, got the idea of yanking it from memory to atleast get an idea of what's going on  

This is a work in progress! Cleaner code and arguments shall come. Also, I hate javascript

ToDos:
  1. Clean up code, make it more efficient? Add arguments, etc.
  2. Figure out how to clean up the binary itself to make it more of a decent copy than rip, whatever
  3. Figure out what's up with the sizes from memory than the actual binary on disk. No clue what the deal is with that
